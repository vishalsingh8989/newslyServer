Title :  b'Apple Confirms It Degrades Your Old iPhone'
Summa :  b'Following significant examination by third parties, Apple today has confirmed that its software does degrade the performance of older iPhones.\nIn a series of tweets he revealed Powerd is \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for controlling the CPU/GPU speed and power usage based on iPhone battery health\xe2\x80\x9d.\nLast year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions.\nCan Apple really not guarantee battery performance for that length of time?\nThis is not the mythical \xe2\x80\x98kill-switch\xe2\x80\x99 that cripples an older iPhone just as a new iPhone is announced.'

Summa :  b'Instead, Apple is focusing attention on smoothing out the very high and quick peaks of power draw that can cause problems with older batteries.\nBasically, iPhones were hitting peaks of processor power that the battery was unable to power and the phones were shutting off.\nSome users who have had older batteries replaced also said they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen improved benchmarks after replacing their batteries.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think users who experience significant slowdowns due to battery wear would want Apple to be more transparent about this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d says Poole.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that people just didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that protecting an iPhone with an older battery was going to directly affect performance.'

Title :  b'Winners and losers from the first day of the early college football signing period'
Summa :  b'In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer signing day but signing days, plural, commencing Wednesday with the early signing period enacted by college coaches earlier this year.\nBut there are several takeaways from the start of the early signing period.\nHere are the early recruiting winners and losers, which come with a caveat: There\xe2\x80\x99s a long time to go until February.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s partially due to the lack of overall drama and intrigue associated with the early signing period, as well as a byproduct of fewer commitments being aired on national television.\nTraditional signing day : Once part of college football\xe2\x80\x99s annual schedule, the early period has drawn almost all of the air out of February\xe2\x80\x99s signing day.'

Author   : ['Reuters Editorial']
Meta des : b'By Gene Emery(Reuters Health) - - Doctors in Shanghai say they have made paralyzed arms useful again by surgically swapping a nerve coming out of the spinal cord.A year after the surgery, "the paralyzed arm showed improved power, function and reduced spasticity," they report in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the small study is sparking skepticism because the improvements seemed to appear faster than nerves are typically able to grow. Dr. Robert Spinner, chairman of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it\'s possible the benefits were caused by simply cutting the bad nerve leading to the affected arm, a much simpler procedure than the nerve transfer surgery."These results are very exciting because this is a very big problem in America and the world. The question really is, what\'s causing the effect," he said in a telephone interview. "To cut the bad wire would be a lot easier than doing their procedure." The senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Dong Xu of Fudan University, did not respond to emailed questions.The randomized trial involved 36 men at Huashan Hospital, all of whom had at least some muscle power and the ability detect touch. Their paralysis was due to brain injuries including strokes, cerebral palsy and head trauma. On average, patients had been paralyzed for 15 years and had undergone 10 years of rehabilitation.In 18 patients, surgeons found a nerve feeding the affected arm - the C7 nerve, which exits the spine at the base of the neck - and severed it near the spinal cord. The C7 accounts for about 20% of the nerve impulses going into an arm.Then, on the other side of the spinal cord, surgeons cut the healthy C7 nerve feeding the unaffected arm, rerouted it behind the esophagus, and grafted it onto the nerve leading to the affected arm. The hope was to give control of the paralyzed arm to a healthy part of the brain. The other 18 volunteers simply received the same four-times-per-week rehabilitation regimen that the surgery group did.On a 67-point movement scale, the surgery group collectively started at 29.0 points and ended at 46.7 after 12 months. Volunteers in the rehabilitation-only group went from 29.1 points to 31.7 points. Before surgery, none of the patients could reach or grasp with the paralyzed hand, and none could dress, tie shoes, wring out a towel, or operate a mobile phone with the affected arm and hand, researchers reported.After surgery, 16 of the 18 could perform at least three of those tasks. None of the rehabilitation-only patients could. There were side effects. Twelve patients in the surgery group reported a strange feeling while swallowing and 15 reported fatigue. In the healthy arm that originally got signals from the C7 nerve, hand numbness was reported by 16 people, 16 said they couldn\'t extend their wrists with as much force as they could before, 15 said they couldn\'t extend their elbow as forcefully as before, and 16 reported lessened sensory function. The side effects often subsided over time.The Xu team acknowledged that just severing the nerve leading to the paralyzed arm may have helped release the spasticity, making rehabilitation easier. But they said there was evidence that nerve cells were reconnecting the brain to the arm.The results \xe2\x80\x9care exciting but need clarification and confirmation," Spinner and two colleagues wrote in a Journal editorial.They noted that nerves usually grow an inch per month, so 12 months would not be enough time to make a direct connection from the spine to the hand."Nerves do not regenerate that quickly, fully, or consistently," they said.It\'s more likely that cutting the nerve produced the benefits by stopping the hand and arm muscles from spasming, allowing other nerves that move the arm to work more effectively, Spinner believes. One way to test that would be to just cut the C7 nerve and see if that is enough to produce the improvements, he said. "In their paper they say they saw some improvements after one month,\xe2\x80\x9d Spinner noted. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that can\'t be from regeneration. Usually full results from long-distance regeneration take several years."SOURCE: bit.ly/2oXfJpu The New England Journal of Medicine, online December 20, 2017.'

Summa :  b'The bird flu virus H7N9, for example, is known to have infected more than 1,500 people, and 40 percent of them died.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services released a new framework for making decisions about funding research that has the potential to create a new pandemic strain.\nIn 2011, scientists revealed that they had deliberately made forms of a deadly bird flu that could transmit easily among ferrets, the stand-in for people in flu studies.\nThe issue flared up again after unrelated mishaps involving anthrax and bird flu heightened concerns about lab accidents.\nAt about the same time, the Ebola outbreak provided a vivid example of how a deadly, contagious virus could kill thousands.'

Summa :  b'They caught a break when Democrats reached a deal with Mr. Trump to keep the government open in early fall, freeing up valuable legislative time to push the tax bill forward.\nAt the time of the health care collapse, Republicans had made little public progress toward a tax bill, and it appeared on the back burner.\nMr. Trump beat a public drum for the tax bill throughout the process, but he engaged selectively on policy details, often over Twitter, sometimes backed with phone calls.\nOn a long trip to Asia, Mr. Trump often called Mr. Brady to discuss the bills.\nIn late November, Mr. Trump flew to the St. Louis suburbs to rally for the tax bill on a stage decorated for the holidays.'

Summa :  b'For many critics, Pope Francis has not made good on his early promise to remove the deep stain of child sex abuse from the church.\nBut there are also many who have a perspective more sympathetic to Cardinal Law.\nPhotoEven as the scandal engulfed the United States and built pressure on Cardinal Law to resign, he seemed to expect a reprieve in Rome.\nIf Cardinal Law was ashamed to show his face, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t show it, often attending Rome\xe2\x80\x99s embassy events and church receptions.\nCardinal Law renovated the place himself several years ago, and supporters like Monsignor Di Ciocco believe he deserves such a place of honor.'

Summa :  b'The agency said Rhode Island had 1,059,639 residents as of July 1, an increase of about 2,000 or 0.2% compared with a year earlier.\nThe state\xe2\x80\x99s population has grown by about 7,500 residents since 2011.\nThough Rhode Island was not among the eight states that actually lost population in the 12 months ended July 1, it remains one of the slowest-growing states in the nation.\nOnce again, the overall increase in residents masked a larger shift in terms of who lives in Rhode Island.\nMassachusetts was close behind Rhode Island at 80% adults.'

Title :  b'Give Thanks for the Winter Solstice. You Might Not Be Here Without It.'
Summa :  b'In New York City, for example, the sun will be in the sky for just over nine hours \xe2\x80\x94 roughly six hours less than in June at the summer solstice.\nThe winter solstice marks the shortest day of the year, before the sun reverses course and climbs higher into the sky.\n(At the same time, places like Australia in the Southern Hemisphere mark the summer solstice, the longest day of the year.)\nThis leaves the planet\xe2\x80\x99s North Pole pointed toward the North Star over relatively long periods of time, even as Earth makes its yearlong migration around the sun.\nDec. 21 marks the day when the North Pole is most tilted away from the sun.'

Title :  b'Dec. 21 will be the worst day of 2017, astrologers say'
Summa :  b'Druids, pagans and revellers gather Dec. 21, 2016, at Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument of Stonehenge near Amesbury in Wiltshire, England.\n(Photo: Matt Cardy, Getty Images)The winter solstice \xe2\x80\x94 also known as Yule, Midwinter, the Shortest Day of the Year and the Longest Night \xe2\x80\x94 occurs at 11:28 a.m.\nBut this short, little day with the great many names also may be the worst day of the year, according to astrologers.\nHe insists that starting something new on this day is \xe2\x80\x9cill advised\xe2\x80\x9d and will have long-term consequences.\nThe entrance to the monument, which has a retaining wall made of quartz cobblestones, is aligned with the rising sun on the winter solstice.'

Author   : ['Reuters Editorial']
Meta des : b'By Gene Emery(Reuters Health) - - Doctors in Shanghai say they have made paralyzed arms useful again by surgically swapping a nerve coming out of the spinal cord.A year after the surgery, "the paralyzed arm showed improved power, function and reduced spasticity," they report in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the small study is sparking skepticism because the improvements seemed to appear faster than nerves are typically able to grow. Dr. Robert Spinner, chairman of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it\'s possible the benefits were caused by simply cutting the bad nerve leading to the affected arm, a much simpler procedure than the nerve transfer surgery."These results are very exciting because this is a very big problem in America and the world. The question really is, what\'s causing the effect," he said in a telephone interview. "To cut the bad wire would be a lot easier than doing their procedure." The senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Dong Xu of Fudan University, did not respond to emailed questions.The randomized trial involved 36 men at Huashan Hospital, all of whom had at least some muscle power and the ability detect touch. Their paralysis was due to brain injuries including strokes, cerebral palsy and head trauma. On average, patients had been paralyzed for 15 years and had undergone 10 years of rehabilitation.In 18 patients, surgeons found a nerve feeding the affected arm - the C7 nerve, which exits the spine at the base of the neck - and severed it near the spinal cord. The C7 accounts for about 20% of the nerve impulses going into an arm.Then, on the other side of the spinal cord, surgeons cut the healthy C7 nerve feeding the unaffected arm, rerouted it behind the esophagus, and grafted it onto the nerve leading to the affected arm. The hope was to give control of the paralyzed arm to a healthy part of the brain. The other 18 volunteers simply received the same four-times-per-week rehabilitation regimen that the surgery group did.On a 67-point movement scale, the surgery group collectively started at 29.0 points and ended at 46.7 after 12 months. Volunteers in the rehabilitation-only group went from 29.1 points to 31.7 points. Before surgery, none of the patients could reach or grasp with the paralyzed hand, and none could dress, tie shoes, wring out a towel, or operate a mobile phone with the affected arm and hand, researchers reported.After surgery, 16 of the 18 could perform at least three of those tasks. None of the rehabilitation-only patients could. There were side effects. Twelve patients in the surgery group reported a strange feeling while swallowing and 15 reported fatigue. In the healthy arm that originally got signals from the C7 nerve, hand numbness was reported by 16 people, 16 said they couldn\'t extend their wrists with as much force as they could before, 15 said they couldn\'t extend their elbow as forcefully as before, and 16 reported lessened sensory function. The side effects often subsided over time.The Xu team acknowledged that just severing the nerve leading to the paralyzed arm may have helped release the spasticity, making rehabilitation easier. But they said there was evidence that nerve cells were reconnecting the brain to the arm.The results \xe2\x80\x9care exciting but need clarification and confirmation," Spinner and two colleagues wrote in a Journal editorial.They noted that nerves usually grow an inch per month, so 12 months would not be enough time to make a direct connection from the spine to the hand."Nerves do not regenerate that quickly, fully, or consistently," they said.It\'s more likely that cutting the nerve produced the benefits by stopping the hand and arm muscles from spasming, allowing other nerves that move the arm to work more effectively, Spinner believes. One way to test that would be to just cut the C7 nerve and see if that is enough to produce the improvements, he said. "In their paper they say they saw some improvements after one month,\xe2\x80\x9d Spinner noted. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that can\'t be from regeneration. Usually full results from long-distance regeneration take several years."SOURCE: bit.ly/2oXfJpu The New England Journal of Medicine, online December 20, 2017.'

Summa :  b'Following significant examination by third parties, Apple today has confirmed that its software does degrade the performance of older iPhones.\nIn a series of tweets he revealed Powerd is \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for controlling the CPU/GPU speed and power usage based on iPhone battery health\xe2\x80\x9d.\nLast year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions.\nCan Apple really not guarantee battery performance for that length of time?\nThis is not the mythical \xe2\x80\x98kill-switch\xe2\x80\x99 that cripples an older iPhone just as a new iPhone is announced.'

Summa :  b'Instead, Apple is focusing attention on smoothing out the very high and quick peaks of power draw that can cause problems with older batteries.\nBasically, iPhones were hitting peaks of processor power that the battery was unable to power and the phones were shutting off.\nSome users who have had older batteries replaced also said they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen improved benchmarks after replacing their batteries.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think users who experience significant slowdowns due to battery wear would want Apple to be more transparent about this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d says Poole.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that people just didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that protecting an iPhone with an older battery was going to directly affect performance.'

Author   : ['Reuters Editorial']
Meta des : b'By Gene Emery(Reuters Health) - - Doctors in Shanghai say they have made paralyzed arms useful again by surgically swapping a nerve coming out of the spinal cord.A year after the surgery, "the paralyzed arm showed improved power, function and reduced spasticity," they report in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the small study is sparking skepticism because the improvements seemed to appear faster than nerves are typically able to grow. Dr. Robert Spinner, chairman of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it\'s possible the benefits were caused by simply cutting the bad nerve leading to the affected arm, a much simpler procedure than the nerve transfer surgery."These results are very exciting because this is a very big problem in America and the world. The question really is, what\'s causing the effect," he said in a telephone interview. "To cut the bad wire would be a lot easier than doing their procedure." The senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Dong Xu of Fudan University, did not respond to emailed questions.The randomized trial involved 36 men at Huashan Hospital, all of whom had at least some muscle power and the ability detect touch. Their paralysis was due to brain injuries including strokes, cerebral palsy and head trauma. On average, patients had been paralyzed for 15 years and had undergone 10 years of rehabilitation.In 18 patients, surgeons found a nerve feeding the affected arm - the C7 nerve, which exits the spine at the base of the neck - and severed it near the spinal cord. The C7 accounts for about 20% of the nerve impulses going into an arm.Then, on the other side of the spinal cord, surgeons cut the healthy C7 nerve feeding the unaffected arm, rerouted it behind the esophagus, and grafted it onto the nerve leading to the affected arm. The hope was to give control of the paralyzed arm to a healthy part of the brain. The other 18 volunteers simply received the same four-times-per-week rehabilitation regimen that the surgery group did.On a 67-point movement scale, the surgery group collectively started at 29.0 points and ended at 46.7 after 12 months. Volunteers in the rehabilitation-only group went from 29.1 points to 31.7 points. Before surgery, none of the patients could reach or grasp with the paralyzed hand, and none could dress, tie shoes, wring out a towel, or operate a mobile phone with the affected arm and hand, researchers reported.After surgery, 16 of the 18 could perform at least three of those tasks. None of the rehabilitation-only patients could. There were side effects. Twelve patients in the surgery group reported a strange feeling while swallowing and 15 reported fatigue. In the healthy arm that originally got signals from the C7 nerve, hand numbness was reported by 16 people, 16 said they couldn\'t extend their wrists with as much force as they could before, 15 said they couldn\'t extend their elbow as forcefully as before, and 16 reported lessened sensory function. The side effects often subsided over time.The Xu team acknowledged that just severing the nerve leading to the paralyzed arm may have helped release the spasticity, making rehabilitation easier. But they said there was evidence that nerve cells were reconnecting the brain to the arm.The results \xe2\x80\x9care exciting but need clarification and confirmation," Spinner and two colleagues wrote in a Journal editorial.They noted that nerves usually grow an inch per month, so 12 months would not be enough time to make a direct connection from the spine to the hand."Nerves do not regenerate that quickly, fully, or consistently," they said.It\'s more likely that cutting the nerve produced the benefits by stopping the hand and arm muscles from spasming, allowing other nerves that move the arm to work more effectively, Spinner believes. One way to test that would be to just cut the C7 nerve and see if that is enough to produce the improvements, he said. "In their paper they say they saw some improvements after one month,\xe2\x80\x9d Spinner noted. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that can\'t be from regeneration. Usually full results from long-distance regeneration take several years."SOURCE: bit.ly/2oXfJpu The New England Journal of Medicine, online December 20, 2017.'

Summa :  b'In New York City, for example, the sun will be in the sky for just over nine hours \xe2\x80\x94 roughly six hours less than in June at the summer solstice.\nThe winter solstice marks the shortest day of the year, before the sun reverses course and climbs higher into the sky.\n(At the same time, places like Australia in the Southern Hemisphere mark the summer solstice, the longest day of the year.)\nThis leaves the planet\xe2\x80\x99s North Pole pointed toward the North Star over relatively long periods of time, even as Earth makes its yearlong migration around the sun.\nDec. 21 marks the day when the North Pole is most tilted away from the sun.'

Title :  b'Dec. 21 will be the worst day of 2017, astrologers say'
Summa :  b'Druids, pagans and revellers gather Dec. 21, 2016, at Stonehenge, hoping to see the sun rise as they take part in a winter solstice ceremony at the ancient neolithic monument of Stonehenge near Amesbury in Wiltshire, England.\n(Photo: Matt Cardy, Getty Images)The winter solstice \xe2\x80\x94 also known as Yule, Midwinter, the Shortest Day of the Year and the Longest Night \xe2\x80\x94 occurs at 11:28 a.m.\nBut this short, little day with the great many names also may be the worst day of the year, according to astrologers.\nHe insists that starting something new on this day is \xe2\x80\x9cill advised\xe2\x80\x9d and will have long-term consequences.\nThe entrance to the monument, which has a retaining wall made of quartz cobblestones, is aligned with the rising sun on the winter solstice.'

Author   : ['Reuters Editorial']
Meta des : b'By Gene Emery(Reuters Health) - - Doctors in Shanghai say they have made paralyzed arms useful again by surgically swapping a nerve coming out of the spinal cord.A year after the surgery, "the paralyzed arm showed improved power, function and reduced spasticity," they report in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the small study is sparking skepticism because the improvements seemed to appear faster than nerves are typically able to grow. Dr. Robert Spinner, chairman of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it\'s possible the benefits were caused by simply cutting the bad nerve leading to the affected arm, a much simpler procedure than the nerve transfer surgery."These results are very exciting because this is a very big problem in America and the world. The question really is, what\'s causing the effect," he said in a telephone interview. "To cut the bad wire would be a lot easier than doing their procedure." The senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Dong Xu of Fudan University, did not respond to emailed questions.The randomized trial involved 36 men at Huashan Hospital, all of whom had at least some muscle power and the ability detect touch. Their paralysis was due to brain injuries including strokes, cerebral palsy and head trauma. On average, patients had been paralyzed for 15 years and had undergone 10 years of rehabilitation.In 18 patients, surgeons found a nerve feeding the affected arm - the C7 nerve, which exits the spine at the base of the neck - and severed it near the spinal cord. The C7 accounts for about 20% of the nerve impulses going into an arm.Then, on the other side of the spinal cord, surgeons cut the healthy C7 nerve feeding the unaffected arm, rerouted it behind the esophagus, and grafted it onto the nerve leading to the affected arm. The hope was to give control of the paralyzed arm to a healthy part of the brain. The other 18 volunteers simply received the same four-times-per-week rehabilitation regimen that the surgery group did.On a 67-point movement scale, the surgery group collectively started at 29.0 points and ended at 46.7 after 12 months. Volunteers in the rehabilitation-only group went from 29.1 points to 31.7 points. Before surgery, none of the patients could reach or grasp with the paralyzed hand, and none could dress, tie shoes, wring out a towel, or operate a mobile phone with the affected arm and hand, researchers reported.After surgery, 16 of the 18 could perform at least three of those tasks. None of the rehabilitation-only patients could. There were side effects. Twelve patients in the surgery group reported a strange feeling while swallowing and 15 reported fatigue. In the healthy arm that originally got signals from the C7 nerve, hand numbness was reported by 16 people, 16 said they couldn\'t extend their wrists with as much force as they could before, 15 said they couldn\'t extend their elbow as forcefully as before, and 16 reported lessened sensory function. The side effects often subsided over time.The Xu team acknowledged that just severing the nerve leading to the paralyzed arm may have helped release the spasticity, making rehabilitation easier. But they said there was evidence that nerve cells were reconnecting the brain to the arm.The results \xe2\x80\x9care exciting but need clarification and confirmation," Spinner and two colleagues wrote in a Journal editorial.They noted that nerves usually grow an inch per month, so 12 months would not be enough time to make a direct connection from the spine to the hand."Nerves do not regenerate that quickly, fully, or consistently," they said.It\'s more likely that cutting the nerve produced the benefits by stopping the hand and arm muscles from spasming, allowing other nerves that move the arm to work more effectively, Spinner believes. One way to test that would be to just cut the C7 nerve and see if that is enough to produce the improvements, he said. "In their paper they say they saw some improvements after one month,\xe2\x80\x9d Spinner noted. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that can\'t be from regeneration. Usually full results from long-distance regeneration take several years."SOURCE: bit.ly/2oXfJpu The New England Journal of Medicine, online December 20, 2017.'

Title :  b'Will UN Peacekeepers Be Deployed on the Streets of Chicago?'
Summa :  b'On 14 December 2017 the Chicago Tribune quoted Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin saying he wanted UN Peacekeepers to help put an end to the \xe2\x80\x9cquiet genocide\xe2\x80\x9d of African-Americans in Chicago.\nPer the Tribune he said:The United Nations has a track record of protecting minority populations.\nToday, American nationalists worry that the United Nations wants to undermine American values or institutions in the pursuit of its internationalist agenda.\nThis theory claimed that the United Nations was merely a tool of the Communists, and that the end goal was the complete subjugation of the United States to the United Nations.\nPerhaps in an effort to settle the issue, Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told the Tribune, in response to Boykin\xe2\x80\x99s comments, that UN Peacekeepers have no jurisdiction in Chicago.'

Summa :  b'Following significant examination by third parties, Apple today has confirmed that its software does degrade the performance of older iPhones.\nIn a series of tweets he revealed Powerd is \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for controlling the CPU/GPU speed and power usage based on iPhone battery health\xe2\x80\x9d.\nLast year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions.\nCan Apple really not guarantee battery performance for that length of time?\nThis is not the mythical \xe2\x80\x98kill-switch\xe2\x80\x99 that cripples an older iPhone just as a new iPhone is announced.'

Summa :  b'Instead, Apple is focusing attention on smoothing out the very high and quick peaks of power draw that can cause problems with older batteries.\nBasically, iPhones were hitting peaks of processor power that the battery was unable to power and the phones were shutting off.\nSome users who have had older batteries replaced also said they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen improved benchmarks after replacing their batteries.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think users who experience significant slowdowns due to battery wear would want Apple to be more transparent about this issue,\xe2\x80\x9d says Poole.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that people just didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that protecting an iPhone with an older battery was going to directly affect performance.'

Summa :  b"But to director Steven Spielberg, it's chiefly about one thing: Slow-burning feminism, persistent male chauvinism and the surprising rise of Katherine Graham.\nAnd that seemed to be that, until the scrappy Washington Post got its own copy of the papers.\nAnd that we can watch in detail, as Steven Spielberg brings his camera in close, and we see the decisiveness dawning behind her eyes.\nWell, yes it is, given the talents of Spielberg and Streep.\nDirected by Steven Spielberg."

Author   : ['Reuters Editorial']
Meta des : b'By Gene Emery(Reuters Health) - - Doctors in Shanghai say they have made paralyzed arms useful again by surgically swapping a nerve coming out of the spinal cord.A year after the surgery, "the paralyzed arm showed improved power, function and reduced spasticity," they report in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the small study is sparking skepticism because the improvements seemed to appear faster than nerves are typically able to grow. Dr. Robert Spinner, chairman of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it\'s possible the benefits were caused by simply cutting the bad nerve leading to the affected arm, a much simpler procedure than the nerve transfer surgery."These results are very exciting because this is a very big problem in America and the world. The question really is, what\'s causing the effect," he said in a telephone interview. "To cut the bad wire would be a lot easier than doing their procedure." The senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Dong Xu of Fudan University, did not respond to emailed questions.The randomized trial involved 36 men at Huashan Hospital, all of whom had at least some muscle power and the ability detect touch. Their paralysis was due to brain injuries including strokes, cerebral palsy and head trauma. On average, patients had been paralyzed for 15 years and had undergone 10 years of rehabilitation.In 18 patients, surgeons found a nerve feeding the affected arm - the C7 nerve, which exits the spine at the base of the neck - and severed it near the spinal cord. The C7 accounts for about 20% of the nerve impulses going into an arm.Then, on the other side of the spinal cord, surgeons cut the healthy C7 nerve feeding the unaffected arm, rerouted it behind the esophagus, and grafted it onto the nerve leading to the affected arm. The hope was to give control of the paralyzed arm to a healthy part of the brain. The other 18 volunteers simply received the same four-times-per-week rehabilitation regimen that the surgery group did.On a 67-point movement scale, the surgery group collectively started at 29.0 points and ended at 46.7 after 12 months. Volunteers in the rehabilitation-only group went from 29.1 points to 31.7 points. Before surgery, none of the patients could reach or grasp with the paralyzed hand, and none could dress, tie shoes, wring out a towel, or operate a mobile phone with the affected arm and hand, researchers reported.After surgery, 16 of the 18 could perform at least three of those tasks. None of the rehabilitation-only patients could. There were side effects. Twelve patients in the surgery group reported a strange feeling while swallowing and 15 reported fatigue. In the healthy arm that originally got signals from the C7 nerve, hand numbness was reported by 16 people, 16 said they couldn\'t extend their wrists with as much force as they could before, 15 said they couldn\'t extend their elbow as forcefully as before, and 16 reported lessened sensory function. The side effects often subsided over time.The Xu team acknowledged that just severing the nerve leading to the paralyzed arm may have helped release the spasticity, making rehabilitation easier. But they said there was evidence that nerve cells were reconnecting the brain to the arm.The results \xe2\x80\x9care exciting but need clarification and confirmation," Spinner and two colleagues wrote in a Journal editorial.They noted that nerves usually grow an inch per month, so 12 months would not be enough time to make a direct connection from the spine to the hand."Nerves do not regenerate that quickly, fully, or consistently," they said.It\'s more likely that cutting the nerve produced the benefits by stopping the hand and arm muscles from spasming, allowing other nerves that move the arm to work more effectively, Spinner believes. One way to test that would be to just cut the C7 nerve and see if that is enough to produce the improvements, he said. "In their paper they say they saw some improvements after one month,\xe2\x80\x9d Spinner noted. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that can\'t be from regeneration. Usually full results from long-distance regeneration take several years."SOURCE: bit.ly/2oXfJpu The New England Journal of Medicine, online December 20, 2017.'

Summa :  b"At one point in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Finn and Rose go on a high-stakes mission to Canto Bight, a Monaco-like coastal city harboring the galaxy's super-rich and elite.\nIt's a movie that takes what we know and love about Star Wars and turns all of that on its head.\nLuke's final scenes in the film were among the most powerful in the entire Star Wars saga.\nKylo Ren is easily the most interesting character in the new Star Wars films---played with a raw intensity by Adam Driver that's simply mesmerizing.\nYes, Star Wars could get by on slick nostalgia alone."

Summa :  b'Scientists Use Gene Editing To Prevent A Form Of Deafness in MiceScientists have now edited genes inside mice to prevent a form of inherited deafness.\nWhile cautioning that much more research is needed, the scientists said they hope the technique might someday be used to prevent deafness in children born in families with a history of genetic hearing loss.\nThe latest work follows experiments published in 2015 using a different gene-editing technique to alter the same inherited form of deafness in mice.\nThe development is the latest in the rapidly moving field of gene therapy and gene editing.\nOn Tuesday, the agency approved the first gene therapy to treat an inherited disorder \xe2\x80\x94 a form of inherited blindness.'

Author   : ['Reuters Editorial']
Meta des : b'By Gene Emery(Reuters Health) - - Doctors in Shanghai say they have made paralyzed arms useful again by surgically swapping a nerve coming out of the spinal cord.A year after the surgery, "the paralyzed arm showed improved power, function and reduced spasticity," they report in The New England Journal of Medicine. But the small study is sparking skepticism because the improvements seemed to appear faster than nerves are typically able to grow. Dr. Robert Spinner, chairman of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it\'s possible the benefits were caused by simply cutting the bad nerve leading to the affected arm, a much simpler procedure than the nerve transfer surgery."These results are very exciting because this is a very big problem in America and the world. The question really is, what\'s causing the effect," he said in a telephone interview. "To cut the bad wire would be a lot easier than doing their procedure." The senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Dong Xu of Fudan University, did not respond to emailed questions.The randomized trial involved 36 men at Huashan Hospital, all of whom had at least some muscle power and the ability detect touch. Their paralysis was due to brain injuries including strokes, cerebral palsy and head trauma. On average, patients had been paralyzed for 15 years and had undergone 10 years of rehabilitation.In 18 patients, surgeons found a nerve feeding the affected arm - the C7 nerve, which exits the spine at the base of the neck - and severed it near the spinal cord. The C7 accounts for about 20% of the nerve impulses going into an arm.Then, on the other side of the spinal cord, surgeons cut the healthy C7 nerve feeding the unaffected arm, rerouted it behind the esophagus, and grafted it onto the nerve leading to the affected arm. The hope was to give control of the paralyzed arm to a healthy part of the brain. The other 18 volunteers simply received the same four-times-per-week rehabilitation regimen that the surgery group did.On a 67-point movement scale, the surgery group collectively started at 29.0 points and ended at 46.7 after 12 months. Volunteers in the rehabilitation-only group went from 29.1 points to 31.7 points. Before surgery, none of the patients could reach or grasp with the paralyzed hand, and none could dress, tie shoes, wring out a towel, or operate a mobile phone with the affected arm and hand, researchers reported.After surgery, 16 of the 18 could perform at least three of those tasks. None of the rehabilitation-only patients could. There were side effects. Twelve patients in the surgery group reported a strange feeling while swallowing and 15 reported fatigue. In the healthy arm that originally got signals from the C7 nerve, hand numbness was reported by 16 people, 16 said they couldn\'t extend their wrists with as much force as they could before, 15 said they couldn\'t extend their elbow as forcefully as before, and 16 reported lessened sensory function. The side effects often subsided over time.The Xu team acknowledged that just severing the nerve leading to the paralyzed arm may have helped release the spasticity, making rehabilitation easier. But they said there was evidence that nerve cells were reconnecting the brain to the arm.The results \xe2\x80\x9care exciting but need clarification and confirmation," Spinner and two colleagues wrote in a Journal editorial.They noted that nerves usually grow an inch per month, so 12 months would not be enough time to make a direct connection from the spine to the hand."Nerves do not regenerate that quickly, fully, or consistently," they said.It\'s more likely that cutting the nerve produced the benefits by stopping the hand and arm muscles from spasming, allowing other nerves that move the arm to work more effectively, Spinner believes. One way to test that would be to just cut the C7 nerve and see if that is enough to produce the improvements, he said. "In their paper they say they saw some improvements after one month,\xe2\x80\x9d Spinner noted. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly that can\'t be from regeneration. Usually full results from long-distance regeneration take several years."SOURCE: bit.ly/2oXfJpu The New England Journal of Medicine, online December 20, 2017.'
