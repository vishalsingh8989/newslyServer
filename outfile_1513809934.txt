Title :  b'European Ruling Buries Uber\xe2\x80\x99s Platform Myth'
Summa :  b'The ruling ends a legal battle started in 2014 by a taxi drivers\' association in Barcelona, called Associacion Profesional Elite Taxi.\nThe ECJ decision tells these countries, too, that Uber is a taxi service and should be treated as such.\nMore importantly, however, the ECJ decision creates a precedent for looking at what tech companies actually do, not how they do it.\nA technology-enabled taxi service, media company or accommodation service does, at its core, what such services have always done, except now with technology.\nIt\'ll probably be useful in the long run that the tech companies, mostly U.S.-based, have gotten something of a head start thanks to regulatory confusion about the misleading "platform" concept.'

Summa :  b'The bird flu virus H7N9, for example, is known to have infected more than 1,500 people, and 40 percent of them died.\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services released a new framework for making decisions about funding research that has the potential to create a new pandemic strain.\nIn 2011, scientists revealed that they had deliberately made forms of a deadly bird flu that could transmit easily among ferrets, the stand-in for people in flu studies.\nThe issue flared up again after unrelated mishaps involving anthrax and bird flu heightened concerns about lab accidents.\nAt about the same time, the Ebola outbreak provided a vivid example of how a deadly, contagious virus could kill thousands.'
